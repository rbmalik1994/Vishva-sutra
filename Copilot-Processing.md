User request: Scaffold a minimal Turborepo monorepo for a Todo/Notes app using pnpm workspaces, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and a custom Tailwind-based UI package with theming and accessibility guidance. Deliverable: a scaffold-generation prompt detailing file/folder list, scripts, configs, minimal code samples, validation checklist. No code implementation, just instructions.
Context: Provide plan and outputs per specification. Must follow accessibility and repo instructions.

Action plan:
- [x] Analyze requirements and constraints from user prompt and repo instructions.
- [x] Draft scaffold-generation prompt structure (folders/files, scripts, configs).
- [x] Add minimal code snippets (App.tsx, ThemeProvider usage, pre-hydration script) and validation commands.
- [x] Review for accessibility, security, testing guidance alignment.
- [x] Finalize response with cohesive prompt and checklist.

Summary: Generated a comprehensive scaffold-generation prompt for a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo covering web app, optional API/CLI/SDK, shared configs, UI package with theming and accessibility, scripts, validation commands, and minimal code examples.
