# AGENTS

This repository uses automation agents to assist with development workflows, code changes, reviews, and CI tasks. This document describes the agent types, how they are triggered, safety guidance, and how to add new agents.

 

## Goals
- Provide a clear, auditable place to document repository automation.
- Describe how to run and review agents locally and in CI.
- Explain required safety and secret-handling practices.

## Agent Types
- Coding agent: programmatic assistants that can propose or apply code changes (e.g., draft PRs, patch files). Treat outputs as drafts requiring human review.
- Reviewer agent: runs linters, static analysis, and automated code-review checks and posts results to PRs.
- CI agent: runs tests, builds, and release tasks in CI (GitHub Actions or other runners).
- Maintenance agent: scheduled jobs (dependency updates, formatting, housekeeping).

## How agents are triggered
- GitHub Actions / Workflows: check `.github/workflows/` for workflow definitions and triggers.
- Branch / PR events: automated agents may run on push, PR creation, or via scheduled cron.
- Local scripts: look in the `scripts/` directory for scripts that can be invoked manually.

## Running agents locally
- Inspect any script before running. Example patterns:

  - Run a local lint/test runner:

    ```bash
    # example — adapt to repo scripts
    ./scripts/run-lint.sh
    ./scripts/run-tests.sh
    ```

  - Run a generator/coding agent locally only if you trust its source and inputs.

## Safety & secrets
- Never embed secrets (API keys, tokens) in agent inputs, code, or logs. Use environment variables and GitHub Secrets.
- Review any code changes generated by an agent before merging.
- Prefer read-only dry-run modes for unfamiliar agents.

## Adding a new agent
1. Add a short description and entrypoint to this file.
2. Add scripts under `scripts/` and/or a workflow under `.github/workflows/` with appropriate permissions.
3. Document inputs, outputs, expected side effects, and required secrets.
4. Ensure the agent supports a dry-run mode and logs non-sensitive diagnostic information.

## Audit & ownership
- Document the owner(s) for each agent in this file or in a linked runbook.
- Keep runbooks or examples in `docs/` or `.github/` when longer instructions are required.
